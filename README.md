## Overview

![screenshot](/my_team_screenshot.JPG)

I used CSS display: flex, flex-wrap: wrap and flex-direction: column; to create the grid layout for this challenge.  This means that the order of the team members are not as the user story when the small screen size is selected but the spacing is kept consistent with the user story.  I would appreciate any feedback on how I could keep the order as it should be on the smaller screen.  Thanks for checking out my challenge solution.
